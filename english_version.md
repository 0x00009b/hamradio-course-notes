Sizes and units - units are defined by law In 1969, the SI units became legal units by law

SI units length l in meters time t in seconds mass m in kilograms current strength I in amperes temperature in kelvin amount of substance in moles light intensity in candela

This results in the following units:

Charge Q in Coloumb C = AS Voltage u in volts Power P in watts (W = VA) El. 
Field strength E in volts per meter (V / M) Magn.
Field strength H in amperes per meter (A / M) Frequency f in Hertz (Hz = 1 / s) 
Resistance R in Ohm (R = V / A) Conductance G in Siemens (S = 1 / Omega)
